# CoundownProject

This is my first project involving HTML, CSS, and Javascript code. It displays a timer showing how long it is until the new year in terms of days, hours, minutes, and 
seconds. I have also provided a lovely background image taken from https://unsplash.com . These images should be for free, and you can use any for a background-image.
I recommend a light background so you can clearly see the numbers and text. To open it, go into your Chrome browser, hit Ctrl+O, find the index.html file and open it.
It will continue ticking until it is Janury 1, 2024. The year will be updated as needed.
